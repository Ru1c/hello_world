1. Stationarity
    - μ is const.
    - σ is const.
    - No seasonality

    check: visual, global vs local test, ADF test.
  
2. Unit Roots

    If have unit root, cannot use time series(t.s.). 

    Either do transformation and continue with t.s. or shift to other modeling methods.
  
3. Dickey Fuller Test and Augmented Dickey Fuller(ADF) Test

    DFT is for AR(1);ADFT is for AR(order>1).

    H0: Q=1 ,unit root, not stationary
    
    H1: Q<1 ,no unit root, stationary
  
4. White Noise (non-predictable)

    Yt= signal+ white noise

    when a model have exhausted the variable effect and only left white noise unpredicted, then the model is done.

    - mean is 0
    - std dev is const. with time
    - correlation between lags is 0
 
5. ACF and PACF
6. AR and MA
7. ARMA
8. ARIMA
9. AIC and BIC (not only for time series models)
