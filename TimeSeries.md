1. Stationarity
  - μ is const.
  - σ is const.
  - No seasonality
  
  check: visual, global vs local test, ADF test.
  
3. Unit Roots

  If have unit root, cannot use time series(t.s.). 
  
  Either do transformation and continue with t.s. or shift to other modeling methods.
  
5. Dickey Fuller Test and Augmented Dickey Fuller(ADF) Test

  DFT is for AR(1);ADFT is for AR(order>1).
  
  H0: Q=1 ,unit root, not stationary
  H1: Q<1 ,no unit root, stationary
  
7. White Noise (non-predictable)
  
  Yt= signal+ white noise
  
  when a model have exhausted the variable effect and only left white noise unpredicted, then the model is done.
  
  - mean is 0
  - std dev is const. with time
  - correlation between lags is 0
 
9. ACF and PACF
10. AR and MA
11. ARMA
12. ARIMA
13. AIC and BIC (not only for time series models)
